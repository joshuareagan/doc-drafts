# `=? "tiswut"`

`[$tswt p/wing q/hoon r/hoon s/hoon]`: conditionally change one leg in the subject.

## Expands to

```
=.  p  ?:(q r p)
s
```

## Syntax

Regular: *4-fixed*.

## Discussion

Use `=?` to replace the value of leg `p` with `r` on condition `q`. As
usual, we are not actually mutating the subject, just creating
a new subject with a changed value.  The change in value includes a
type check against the old subject; the type of `r` must nest under
the type of `p`.

## Examples

```
> =a 12

> =?(a =(1 1) 22 a)
22

> =?(a =(1 2) 22 a)
12
```
