# `|: "barcol"`

`[%brcl p=hoon q=hoon]`: form a gate with burnt sample.

## Expands to

```
=>  ^~  p
  |.  q
```

## Discussion

Pick your own default value for the sample.  Note that `p` is an ordinary expression, not a type; `|:` doesn't bunt a sample as
[`|=`](../tis) does.

## Syntax

Regular: *2-fixed*.
